 - A static method is a method that can executed without creating any object for the class
 - Usually when you want to create a console application you will search for the console application project type in your IDE
 - You will also have to set the .NET framework majority of the time
 - Every C# file needs to have a class name 
 - The class name does not have to be the same as the file name

-- Subsection 18

 - The console is a class in the system namespace, which can be used to perform I/P operations in console applications 
 - Console methods are all "static"
 - Some useful console methods:
    Write() - prints out value passed in
    WrietLine() - prints out value on a new line
    ReadKey() - waits until the user presses any key on th keyboard, user input
    Clear() - clears the console window 
    ReadLine() - accepts a string value from the keyboard *Will always be a string*

- You cannot have multiple static main methods in rider your best bet to get this working quick and fast is to make the class with what you want to do and then make the methods public and static so you can call them individaully in your Runner.cs file
